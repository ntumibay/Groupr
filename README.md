# Introduction
The web application will serve as a scheduler for groups. Users will be able to put their schedules onto the site, for the rest of the group to see. Group members can also decide who will be able to assign tasks to individuals. When a task is completed, the user can mark it, and the next time a user logs on, they will see that certain assignments have been finished, regardless of whether or not it was assigned to them.

Our goal with this project is to make group planning simple, accessible, and efficient. 

# Core Features:
Users will be able to upload their own schedules (time, date, descriptions), to be available for display to the other members in their group.
Users (who are assigned permission) can assign tasks to be completed by assigned members.
An overall project timeline can be displayed which visualizes the deadlines for each task

# Extra Features:
Users will be able to view all group members schedules and how their free time overlap for planning purposes
Users can customize their group title, description, and background images.
Users can assign ranks and stats to group members based on the number of completed tasks (their contributions).
